# “If the user can’t use it, it doesn’t work.” _Susan Dray_ 

---
I am passionate about technology and human behaviour, and how they interact with one another. I want to be involved in designing and building software that feels intuitive, user friendly and accessible to all.

# The brief

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

## The project
We chose to design an app aimed at children 8 to 11 years old to help them recognise geographical points of interest. The user will be shown an image of a famous landmark, and be asked to click a map to show where in the world they think this famous landmark is located. The user will then find out if their guess was correct, and will be shown some interesting facts on the famous landmark and the country it is in. 

> I would like to share the UX methods we used our project, and the accessibility considerations we made

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

The final element.
