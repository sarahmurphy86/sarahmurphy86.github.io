# My work
<img src="https://sarahmurphy86.github.io/assets/edinburgh_fringe_festival_image.png" alt="Text on image reads Portfolio- Edinburgh Fringe Review" width="20%" height="40%" align="left"> As a long time user of the  Edinburgh Fringe Festival website, I have always struggled to find shows by time. Therefore, I thought this would be a great opportunity to address the problem with a design solution.

<img src="https://sarahmurphy86.github.io/assets/bbc_project_image.png" alt="Text on image reads Portfolio- The BBC Project" width="20%" height="40%" align="left"> As part of my final project at [CodeClan] (https://codeclan.com), I was tasked to to build an interactive app for the BBC.

Scroll down the page to take a look at how I went about doing this. 

# The BBC Project

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way. Working collaboratively in a team of four, your goal is to produce a full stack web application (vanilla JavaScript, Express and Mongo).


>We chose to design an app aimed at children 8 to 11 years old to help them recognise geographical points of interest. The user will be shown an image of a famous landmark, and be asked to click a map to show where in the world they think this famous landmark is located. The user will then find out if their guess was correct, and will be shown some interesting facts on the famous landmark and the country it is in. 

## What problem are we trying to solve?
1. The BBC believe that children We would like to improve children’s understanding of where the different countries are in the world and what continent they are in
2. We would like to increase children’s knowledge of human/man-made and natural/physical geography

### Our approach...

#### Proto-personas

What do our users want - who are they, how do they behave and what are their goals?

#### User needs

What do our users need and what does success look like?

| As a...                    | I want to...                                                                                                | So that ...                                               |

| Primary school teacher     | Have an educational game that is free to use and and I can share with my class                              |My students can learn about geography and have fun doing it|

#### User action and system response

#### Process map
What does the user flow look like when the user interacts with the app

#### Sketches and wireframes

Whether it is pen and paper or UXPin, we all needed a clear idea of what we were working towards...

#### Prototype

After building an interactive mock-up of the site that we were all happy with, we started building our app.

You can take a look at the prototype by downloading the HTML code below.

#### User testing

*   3 users
    - 10 year old male - student
    - 13 year old female - student
    - 50 year old female - teacher and parent

#### An iterative process...

Following our user testing, the following changes were made to the app:-

1. **Submit button made visible** - we worked on CSS to ensure that the submit button was visible on the page without the need for the user to scroll to find it
2. **Colour overlay changed** - the colour overlay used to indicate what country had been clicked was changed from green to orange
3. **Images of character** -  our character was added to the pictures of the famous landmarks to ensure that the narrative flowed
4. **Landmark pin** - work was done on this to ensure the landmark pin clearly indicated the country
5. **Voice over** - added to the app to indicate whether the user had guessed correctly 

#### Accessibility considerations

| Feature                               | Why                                                                                          | 
|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| !DOCTYPE HTML                         | Helps screenreaders                                                                          |
| Font size set as a % or em            | Allows user to change font size to their liking                                              |
| Font is Sans Serif                    | Recommended on British Dyslexia Association website (font used is Dosis - child friendly too)|
| Try to make colours dyslexia friendly | Most users prefer dark print on a pale background. Colour preferences vary                   |
| Alt text for images                   | Helps screen readers                                                                         |
| Test site with Colour Oracle          | Ensure site provides a good experience if you do not have 100% colour vision                 |

#### Design improvements
The users suggested the following improvements, if we had more time we would have liked to implement these:
* All users liked the idea of “hotter” and “colder” clues dependent on your country guess
* All users liked the ideas of a “hints” button
* Users would have liked this to be a game with a points system

#### Challenges
* Ensuring that the team kept the user at the heart of the product (not adding 'cool' features because we can)
* Time constraints
* Adapting to working with a new team with different working styles

#### Key takeaway
* Trying to design something simple and easy to use is difficult
