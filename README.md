# “If the user can’t use it, it doesn’t work.” _Susan Dray_

I am passionate about technology and human behaviour, and how they interact with one another. I want to design and build software that feels intuitive, user friendly and accessible to all.

# The brief

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.


>We chose to design an app aimed at children 8 to 11 years old to help them recognise geographical points of interest. The user will be shown an image of a famous landmark, and be asked to click a map to show where in the world they think this famous landmark is located. The user will then find out if their guess was correct, and will be shown some interesting facts on the famous landmark and the country it is in. 


I would like to share the UX methods we used our project, and the accessibility considerations we made

## Discovery Methods

### Proto-personas

Who are our users, how do they behave and what are their needs and goals?

### User Needs:

What do our users need and what does success look like?

| As a...                    | I want to...                                                                                                | So that ...                                               |
|:---------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| Eight  year old boy        | Learn about where the countries of the world                                                                |I can improve on my geography                              | 
| Ten year old girl          | Play a cool game                                                                                            |I can have a competition with my friends                   |         
| Person who is colourblind  | Be able to interact with the app easily,and not need to rely on colours alone to navigate through the site  |I can join in the fun too                                  |
| Primary school teacher     | Have an educational game that is free to use and and I can share with my class                              |My students can learn about geography and have fun doing it|

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```
Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
